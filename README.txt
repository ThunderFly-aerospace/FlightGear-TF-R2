Hi,

We would like to thank you for downloading our GTA V Premier.  This is without a doubt a project for motorists. 

All our vehicles is capable of driving on most terrains.  Theoretically, it can drive on water as well, but sometimes it will still crash in Flightgear.  Therefore, we strongly suggest you to drive around water instead.

Please visit our website or Github and download our add-on sound folder (Version 2016.2.3 or newer).

If you believe that our vehicle has an error, you should inform us by visiting our website.  

We hope you enjoy our vehicle and we are looking forward to seeing snapshots and videos of your journey in the FG forum, Youtube and social media sites.

Best regards,

Bulldog RS (Part of Aucafly Group) Team
